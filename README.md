# Travel-Blog-App
Intern @ TECHCORPS

This was one of two apps that another intern and I created during my internship. Both of these apps served as templates for numerous Hackathons hosted by TECHCORPS across Ohio. For the past 2 years, these Hackathon templates have been used for over 10 different Hackathons. This app, specifically, is a social media "blog" app that allows users to change their location, upload information to a blog post, post images, and view a calendar to plan out their travels. The code for this app in particular was taken from another template in Swift Playgrounds as inspiration.
